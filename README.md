HxMathParser
============

Simple equation parser, ported from http://cogitolearning.co.uk/?p=523

This is NOT intended for actually solving equations, or real use, it was simply an exercise in learning parsers and may be useful as reference to some.

Note that I do not even fully understand how this works, I just followed along with the article, which I will likely be reading over to get a better grasp of it.
